You are an expert software architect and senior developer. 

This is a checklist that must go beyond simple syntax or style checks. Instead, it must focus on subjective but critical aspects of software quality, including architectural principles, design patterns, and common anti-patterns. The goal is to create a guide that helps reviewers assess the maintainability, scalability, and overall health of the code.

Please generate the checklist in **Markdown format**.


### ## üèõÔ∏è SOLID Principles

For each of the five SOLID principles, check its use in the code above.

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### ## ‚úçÔ∏è General Principles & Readability

For each one of the principles below, check if the code above is following them

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Focus on identifying duplicated logic.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Focus on avoiding unnecessary complexity.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Focus on preventing speculative, unused code.
* **Clarity and Naming:** Focus on how intuitive the code is.
* **Coupling and Cohesion:** Focus on module independence and logical grouping.

### ## üö´ Common Anti-Patterns Checklist

Please verify if the code is using anyone of the issues below:

* **God Object / God Class**
* **Spaghetti Code**
* **Magic Numbers / Strings**
* **Golden Hammer**
* **Premature Optimization**
* **Reinventing the Wheel**
* **Anemic Domain Model**

### ## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Concerns

Please evaluate the following aspects of the code:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Check if distinct responsibilities (e.g., UI, business logic, data access) are properly separated.
* **Error Handling:** Evaluate the robustness and consistency of the error handling strategy.
* **State Management:** Assess how application state is managed. Is it predictable and easy to reason about?
* **Configuration Management:** Check how configuration values are handled. Are they hard-coded or managed externally?

---

**Final Output Requirements:**
* The entire response must be in Markdown.
* Use level 2 headings (`##`) for the main sections.
* Use bold text (`**`) to highlight key terms and principles.
* Use bullet points (`*`) for all checklist items.
* The tone should be professional, clear, and helpful for developers at all levels.

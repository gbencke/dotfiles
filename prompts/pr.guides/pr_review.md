Steps:

1. Analyze current changes:
   - Run `git status` to see modified files
   - Run `git diff --staged` for staged changes
   - Run `git diff` for unstaged changes
   - Run `git log -1 --stat` for last commit details

2. Security Review:
   - Check for hardcoded credentials or API keys
   - Identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Look for XSS vulnerabilities in web code
   - Verify proper input validation
   - Check for exposed sensitive data in logs
   - Review shell script quoting and escaping
   - Verify no command injection vulnerabilities

3. Code Quality:
   - Verify adherence to project coding standards
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Ensure meaningful variable/function names
   - Look for code duplication
   - Verify SOLID principles adherence
   - Check adherence to project conventions in CLAUDE.md
   - Ensure Deno best practices are followed

4. Test Coverage:
   - Ensure new code has corresponding tests
   - Check that tests cover edge cases
   - Verify tests are meaningful, not just coverage padding
   - Look for missing integration tests
   - Confirm tests follow Deno.test conventions

5. Performance Review:
   - Identify O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms
   - Check for unnecessary database queries (N+1 problems)
   - Look for blocking I/O that should be async
   - Verify efficient data structures are used
   - Check for inefficient file operations

6. Documentation:
   - Ensure complex logic is commented
   - Verify API changes are documented
   - Check that README is updated if needed
   - Ensure CLAUDE.md is updated for new conventions

7. Project-Specific Checks:
   - Verify shell configurations are portable
   - Check backup/restore logic is maintained
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
   - Validate Deno task definitions

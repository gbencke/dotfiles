# ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English Skill

Rewrite text into **Simplified Technical English (STE)**, the ASD-STE100 controlled language for technical documentation. STE was built so that any reader — especially a non-native English speaker — understands the text on the first read, and so that translation and maintenance stay cheap and safe.

STE is **not** plain English. Plain English aims for general clarity. STE enforces precise rules: a restricted vocabulary where each word has one meaning and one part of speech, and a fixed set of grammar and structure rules.

## The Two Parts of ASD-STE100

| Part | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **Writing rules** | ~65 rules across 9 sections covering words, grammar, style, sentence and paragraph structure, procedures, and safety instructions. |
| **Dictionary** | ~900 approved general words. Each has one approved meaning and one approved part of speech, with STE and non-STE example sentences. |

Beyond the dictionary you may add **Technical Names** (nouns for parts, tools, materials — e.g. "grease", "runway") and **Technical Verbs** (project-specific actions — e.g. "to ream", "to rivet"). Everything else must come from the approved dictionary.

## The Core Principle

> **One word, one meaning, one part of speech.**

- **One meaning.** Use a word only with its approved meaning. `follow` means "come after", not "obey" → write *"Obey the safety instructions"*, not *"Follow the safety instructions"*. `fall` means "move down by gravity", not "decrease".
- **One part of speech.** Use a word only as its approved part of speech. `oil` is a noun → *"The oil is dirty"* is allowed; *"Oil the valve"* is not. `test` is a noun → write *"Do the test"*, not *"Test the unit"*.
- **One approved synonym.** Pick the approved word and always use it. Use `start` (not begin/commence/initiate), `make sure` (not verify/check/confirm/ensure), `do` (not achieve/carry out/accomplish), `about` (not concerning/regarding), `help` (not assist/facilitate).

## The Rewriting Process

Run these passes in order. Each targets one layer.

### Pass 1 — Words (Section 1)

- Replace every unapproved word with its approved equivalent or a rephrase.
- Keep each word to its approved meaning and part of speech.
- Keep Technical Names and Technical Verbs; do not "simplify" a correct technical term.
- Cut jargon, slang, and idioms. No figurative language.

| Unapproved | Approved |
|-----------|----------|
| assist / facilitate | help |
| commence / initiate / begin | start |
| verify / ensure / confirm / check | make sure |
| terminate / cease | stop |
| accomplish / perform | do |
| approximately | about |
| prior to | before |
| sufficient | enough |
| additional | more |
| obtain | get |
| utilize | use |
| deactivate | de-energize / set to off (per project) |

### Pass 2 — Noun clusters (Section 2)

A noun cluster is a string of nouns used as one idea. **Maximum three words.** More than three forces the reader to guess the relationships.

- Allowed: *"overhead panel"*, *"runway light"*.
- Not allowed: *"overhead panel battery section"*.
- Break long clusters with prepositions and articles: *"the battery section of the overhead panel"*.
- Do not drop articles (a, an, the). STE keeps them for clarity and translation.

### Pass 3 — Verbs and voice (Section 3)

1. **Active voice, always.** Name who does the action.
   - Not: *"The screws must be replaced."* → *"Replace the screws."* (procedure) or *"The mechanic replaces the screws."* (description).
2. **Approved tenses only.** Simple present, simple past, simple future. **No present perfect, no progressive.**
   - Not: *"We have received the reports."* → *"We received the reports."*
3. **No compound / helper verb stacks** beyond the approved auxiliaries and modals (can, must, etc.).

### Pass 4 — Sentences and structure (Sections 4, 6)

- **Descriptive sentence: 25 words maximum.**
- **One topic per paragraph.** Start each paragraph with its topic sentence.
- **Paragraph: 6 sentences maximum.**
- Give information gradually; use key words to link sentences and paragraphs.
- Use a vertical list for parallel items or conditions instead of one long sentence.

### Pass 5 — Procedures (Section 5)

- **Procedural sentence: 20 words maximum.**
- **One instruction per sentence** — unless two actions happen at the same time.
- Write instructions in the **imperative (command) form**: *"Remove the electrical power from the system."*
- If an instruction starts with a condition or descriptive phrase, separate it with a comma: *"Before you remove the panel, de-energize the circuit."*
- Split multi-step non-STE sentences into numbered steps.

### Pass 6 — Safety instructions (Section 7)

Warnings and cautions protect people and equipment. They come **before** the step they apply to.

- Start with a clear command or condition (what to do / not do), then explain the risk.
- `WARNING` = risk of injury or death to persons. `CAUTION` = risk of damage to equipment.
- Example: *"WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE PROBES TOGETHER. IF THE PROBES TOUCH, THEY CAN BECOME DEMAGNETIZED."*

### Pass 7 — Punctuation and word counts (Section 8)

- Use standard punctuation **except the semicolon (;)** — it invites over-long sentences. Split into two sentences instead.
- Use hyphens to join closely related words.
- In a vertical list, the colon (:) ends the lead sentence; each item then counts as a new sentence for word-count limits.
- Text in parentheses counts as one word of the sentence, and also as its own sentence.

## Output Format

When you finish, deliver:

1. **Rewritten text** — fully STE-compliant.
2. **Rule log** — a short bulleted list of the main rules applied, cite the section: `[Word 1.3]`, `[Sentence 5.1]`, `[Voice 3.6]`. Pattern-level, not line-by-line.
3. **Flagged terms** — any word you could not resolve to an approved word without more context, and any term you kept as a Technical Name / Technical Verb.

---

## Execution Rules

- Never invent approved status. If unsure whether a word is approved, flag it: `[⚠ verify against STE dictionary: …]`. The authoritative dictionary is Part 2 of ASD-STE100 (free from asd-ste100.org).
- Never change technical meaning. Losing precision to fit a word limit is a failure, not a simplification. Split the sentence instead.
- Never merge two instructions to save a sentence. One instruction, one sentence.
- Never use passive voice "for variety". Active voice is a hard rule.
- Keep articles and required prepositions even when they add words — they aid comprehension and translation.
- Safety instructions obey the same word limits (20 words) and always precede their step.
- If the text is already short and simple, still verify vocabulary and voice, then output.

## Quick Reference — The STE Checklist

- [ ] Every word approved, or a Technical Name / Technical Verb?
- [ ] Each word used with one approved meaning and part of speech?
- [ ] Active voice?
- [ ] Only simple tenses (no present perfect, no progressive)?
- [ ] Noun clusters ≤ 3 words?
- [ ] Procedural sentence ≤ 20 words? Descriptive ≤ 25?
- [ ] One instruction per sentence?
- [ ] Instructions in imperative form?
- [ ] Paragraph ≤ 6 sentences, one topic, topic sentence first?
- [ ] No semicolons?
- [ ] Warnings/cautions before the step, command first then risk?

If any box is unchecked, revise until it is.

## Examples

**Before (Non-STE):**
> "After you have removed the electrical power from the system, make sure that the refueling panel switches go back to their normal position."  *(23 words, present perfect, two ideas)*

**After (STE):**
> "(1) Remove the electrical power from the system.
> (2) Make sure that the refueling panel switches move back to their normal position."

---

**Before (Non-STE):**
> "The battery is not user-replaceable; it can only be replaced by an approved service provider."  *(passive, semicolon)*

**After (STE):**
> "Do not replace the battery. Only an approved service provider can replace it."

---

**Before (Non-STE):**
> "Verify that the overhead panel battery section indicator illuminates."  *(unapproved verb, 4-word noun cluster)*

**After (STE):**
> "Make sure that the indicator on the battery section of the overhead panel comes on."

---

**Before (Non-STE):**
> "We have received the technical reports and are currently reviewing them."  *(present perfect, progressive)*

**After (STE):**
